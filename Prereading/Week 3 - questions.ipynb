    "The `statsmodels` library has various implementations of the ARIMA models available. `AutoReg` is a purely autoregresive model (no moving average or difference components). It is less flexible, but the fitting procedure is much faster. `ARIMA` provides all the flexibility of an ARIMA model - you can even add seasonal and exogeneous components (i.e., SARIMAX).\n",

    "* The API reference for `AutoReg` can be found [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoReg.html#statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoReg).\n",
    "* You first need to import the `AutoReg` model (code already provided), then create a model object, e.g., `model = AutoReg(ts, lags = 1)` will create an AR(1) model based on the data in `ts`.\n",
    "* You can fit the model by calling `fitted_model = model.fit()`. \n",
    "* The `fitted_model` object has numerous methods that are useful in assessing the model fit. The first you can check is `fitted_model.summary()`. For a detailed description, see the [AutoRegResults](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoRegResults.html#statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoRegResults).\n",
    "* Both `AutoReg` and `ARIMA` provide `fitted_model` objects with the `plot_diagnostics` method as well as the `resid` property, that can be used to evaluate model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the approach is a bit different to the `sklearn` API, where one would simply update the existing class using, e.g., `model.fit(ts)`. There are several Python libraries which use this more familiar API: [Darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/) and [skforecast](https://skforecast.org/0.16.0/) are two examples. We will use some of these libraries later, but for now the `statsmodels` library is more suitable for our purposes. Both Darts and skforecast simply provide wrappers to the `statsmodels` ARIMA object in any case.\n",
